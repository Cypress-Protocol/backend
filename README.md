## Introduction
This README provides essential information for developers working on the Cypress App's backend API, which is built in Go. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, interacting with the VeChain blockchain, managing user data, and supporting the core functionalities of the Cypress app.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following prerequisites:

- **Go**: You need Go installed on your development machine.
- **VeChain Integration**: Familiarize yourself with the VeChain blockchain integration.
- **Database**: Configure your preferred database system, e.g., PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change your directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd cypress-app-backend-go
   ```

3. Install Go packages and dependencies.

   ```bash
   go get
   ```

### Running the Backend
1. Configure your environment variables in a `.env` file for settings like database connection and API keys.

2. Build and run the Go application.

   ```bash
   go build
   ./cypress-app-backend-go
   ```

3. The backend server should be up and running at `http://localhost:8080` (or the configured port).

## Project Structure
- `main.go`: The entry point of the Go application.
- `routes/`: Contains route handlers for API endpoints.
- `controllers/`: Implements business logic and connects to external services (e.g., VeChain).
- `models/`: Defines data structures and database models.
- `db/`: Manages database connection and migrations.
- `config/`: Configuration settings and environment variables.
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions.
- `utils/`: Utility functions.

## Tech Stack
- **Go**: The primary programming language for building the backend.
- **Gin-Gonic**: A web framework for building web applications in Go.
- **VeChain Integration**: Integration with the VeChain blockchain.
- **Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)**: Storage for user data and transactions.

## API Documentation
For detailed information about the available API endpoints and how to use them, refer to the API documentation. This documentation should be maintained separately and is typically hosted separately from the code.

## Database Schema
The database schema is essential for understanding the data structure used in the application. The schema should be documented separately and kept up to date with any changes to the data model.

## Testing
To ensure the quality and reliability of the Cypress App backend, write and run unit tests. Make sure that the tests cover all critical functions and APIs.
